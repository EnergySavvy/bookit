<p>BookIt is the software used internally by EnergySavvy so we can instantly book rooms for impromptu meetings.</p>

<h2>
<a id="why" class="anchor" href="#why" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why?</h2>

<p>We at EnergySavvy love the Google Calendar platform for managing shared, schedulable resources, but when we needed a room <em>right now</em> the Google Calendar interface was too clunky. Rooms were poached, room squatters were rampant, and anarchy reigned. Nobody wants to get kicked out of a room or show up for their rightfully-booked meeting only to find the room occupied. Our Seattleite non-confrontational attitude forced us to find a solution.</p>

<h2>
<a id="open-source" class="anchor" href="#open-source" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Open Source</h2>

<p>BookIt was built at EnergySavvy as a hackathon project because the off-the-shelf options were expensive and clunky. We've open-sourced it so that you can use it yourself. Just create your own .json data file with your resource IDs and floor layout. Instructions are in our <a href="https://github.com/EnergySavvy/bookit/">README</a>.</p>
