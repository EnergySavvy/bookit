Rooms were poached, room squatters were rampant, and anarchy reigned. Nobody wants to get kicked out of a room or show up for their rightfully-booked meeting only to find the room occupied. Our Seattleite non-confrontational attitude forced us to find a solution.\r\n\r\n## Open Source\r\n\r\nBookIt was built at EnergySavvy as a hackathon project because the off-the-shelf options were expensive and clunky. We've open-sourced it so that you can use it yourself. Just create your own .json data file with your resource IDs and floor layout. Instructions are in our [README](https://github.com/EnergySavvy/bookit/).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\nHaving trouble with BookIt? Drop us a line in the [issues](https://github.com/EnergySavvy/bookit/issues) and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
