# Meeting rooms tablets

The tablets located around the office are Samsung Galaxy Tab 8's from [Amazon](www.amazon.com/Samsung-SM-T350-Titanium-Certified-Refurbished/dp/B011842JB4). The process for setting them up is as follows:

## Software setup
* throw away the packaging, charge it a little, start it up
* connect to the EnergySavvy network using shared password (this will have to change when we're not on shared passwords). Let all the auto-updates happen.
* log in as meeting-rooms@energysavvy.com. People who know the meeting rooms password include Maurice and Jason C. This is an @energysavvy.com Google account so it automatically has access to google docs; thus the password should not be publicized or checked in to a repo.
* don't log in to a Samsung account
* set Chrome home page to meeting-rooms.evoworx.org
* install an app to keep the screen always on (eg. "[Keep Screen On](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=si.formias.keepscreenon)")

## Mounting
* use Command damage-free hanging strips (from the mailroom) to attach the tablet to the wall. To keep them interchangeable, each tablet has the same width between the strips. To acheive this, do the following:
    * Take one of the existing tablets off the wall (pull gently)
    * Apply a new set of strips to the matching ones on the wall
    * Remove the backing from the adhesive
    * Push the new tablet into place, sticking it to the strips. Make sure it's nicely centered and ideally not on top of the camera
    * Pull it off
    * Similarly you can now use the new tablet as a template to put new strips wherever you want to mount the new tablet. Note that mounting directly on brick will not work because brick + adhesive don't work well together.
* Use zipties and USB extension cables (from the Southeast supply room) so that the tablet is always plugged in.
